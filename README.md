Application for android based device to display location and velocity

This application is based on a device that I designed myself to record information
about geographic coordinates as well as velocity. All data has a time and date associated with 
each location and velocity. This is the data that the application needs to function.

The data is broken up into "runs" that represent periods of recording. You may navigate between
different recording periods or "runs" to view each data point in time order.
You may also "Play" the run which simulates the "run".

The application is equipt with an speedometer, compass, and google maps to display the data.
It is also available as text above the speedometer.
